## 0. Introduction

On this project the main goal is to clean the data of the provided attacks.csv file using pandas. Once the data is cleaned we will visualized the data in order to validate our assumptions raising different scenarios.


## 1. Assumptions

Firstly we re going to provide a brief overview of the all he aspects involved in the project and what we want to achive with our analysys.
In order to clean acuratey our data based, we set the researj main question to focus que cleaning.

---------------------------------------Validation--------------------------------------
  -  The particularities of each maritime area (temperature, climatology, etc) does affects to the attacks? -
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Which is most dangeruos maritime area? 
- Which are ethe countries with more attacks in each maritime area?
- The own particularities of each maritime area (temperature, climatology, etc) affects to the attacks?
- What is the most likely timeframe where the attacks can occur? Is the same in the two most dangerous areas?
